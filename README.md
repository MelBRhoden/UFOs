# UFOs

# Overview of Project
The request from a client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

# Results:
Welcome to UFO Sightings!

# Summary
* One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis.
* A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields. Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
* Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
